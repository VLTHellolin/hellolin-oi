[My Website](https://hellolin.cf/)

I am a self-taught **programmer** and an **OIer** who always participates in competitive programming. I have a great interest in the fields of **mathematics and computer science**, which gives me the motivation to learn from experts, the courage to keep exploring and the power to keep improving. I am also an **open source developer**, and I am very happy to share my knowledge and help others in the open source community, and I strongly believe in **the unlimited power of teamwork**.

I have a wide range of interests. In addition to programming, I enjoy watching animes and movies, reading novels, playing video games, and more. I'm also a **minimalist**, I don't store any files on my computer desktop and my file system is usually pretty neat.

Here is some additional information about me: social accounts, skills and projects. I'd be happy to become friends with you if I can.
